# Hello-World
Learn how to use GitHub

I'm relatively new to coding, having spent my early working years in accounting. Learned databases on the fly, teaching myself things even before YouTube came about ;)
I am an intermediate coder having mostly used sql and vb but am working on Json and .Net as well.
